**Translation instructions**

	- The source_year field is set to 1850 or 1860.
	- Source is set to county-SS-source_year (i.e ALB-SS-1880)
	- The original_data field is set to the entire row as a JSONB object.
	- The confidence field is set to 0.83 for both assertions and mentions.	
	- Apply the normalization as described in @Normalize.md.
	- Add mention to mentions table.

**Creating the mention_id**

	- The mention_id is created as follows:
		- Each source has a unique prefix: for example: ALB-SS-1850-1, where  "ALB" is the county, "SS" is the source type, "1850" is the year and "1" is the line number from the line field in the row. 
	- If there is already an identical mention_id within this source append a number to it to differentiate it, like this for the first one: ALB-SS-1850-1.1, ALB-SS-1850-1.2 for the second, etc.

**Add enslaver mentions**

	- Add a mention for each row where the status field is "Owner":
		- If the enslaver_full_name has already been added while ingesting this source, don't add this mention.
		- age, race, gender, and birth_year fields are ignored.
		- head is set to true.
		- race is set to "W".
		- Set the legal_status field is set to NULL.
			- The first_name, middle_name, and last_name fields are set, if there.
		- Add mention to mentions table.
	
**Add enslaved persons mentions**

	- This occurs after all mentions for the enslaved people have been added to the mentions table.
		- Add a mention for each row where the status field is not "Owner":
			- The source_year field is set to 1850 or 1860.
			- Set the legal_status field is set to "E".
			- head is set to NULL.
			- Normalize race and gender according to @Normalize.md.
			- Set age, race, gender, and birth_year fields.
			- Add mention to mentions table.

**Add assertions**

	- This occurs after all mentions have been added to the mentions table.
	- Make a look-up table of names from the enslaver_full_name field and the enslaver's mention_id
	- For each enslaved mention {
		- Use the enslaver_full_name field to find the enslaver's mention_id from the look-up table.
		- Create assertion row data:
			- subject: enslaved person's mention_id.
			- predicate: wasEnslavedBy.
			- object: enslaver's mention_id.
			- who: "SS", 
			- start_year: 1850 or 1860.
			- end_year: NULL.	
		- Add assertion to assertions table.
	}

**Add household ID**

	- This occurs after all mentions have been added to the mentions table.
	- For each enslaver mention created, create a household_id as follows:
		- "HS"+source_year+#, where # is the sequential number of the household mention, starting at 1. (i.e HS1850-4546)
	- Then, for every mention, add the appropriate household_id  to the household_id field in the mentions table.
