# Project Startup Procedure

When starting up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Start the SSH Tunnel**:
   Start the SSH tunnel to access the remote Postgres database and API services.
   ```bash
  ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 -i "C:\Bill\CC\js\StageToolsKey.pem" -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 -L 5432:127.0.0.1:5432 bitnami@52.70.208.176 -N
   ```

3. **Start Local Web Server on Port 8000**:
Close any existing local web servers running on port 8000 (such as servers running from other project directories.   Start a simple local web server to serve static files and proxy API requests on port 8000.
   ```bash
   node postGresServer.js
   ```
